## v1.2.1

* **[NEW âœ¨]** Add capabilities from JSON config

## v1.2.0

* **[NEW âœ¨]** Add `Precedes()`, `Follows()`, `Child()`, and `Parent()` methods to `Locator() and Element()` classes.
  * Ex: `DivTag.Parent()` => Locates the parent of a `div` tag.
  * Ex: `DivTag.Child()` => Locates the child of a `div` tag.
  * Ex: `DivTag.Precedes(SpanTag)` => Locates a `div` tag that precedes another `span` tag.
  * Ex: `DivTag.Follows(SpanTag)` => Locates a `div` tag that follows another `span` tag.
* **[REFACTOR ðŸ› ]** YET ANOTHER overhaul to web driver management. Here is the short list:
  * Added mapper classes that map the APIs of driver options and services for Firefox, Chrome, and IE to a common API. This has always been the goal with each iteration of this part of the framework. But this time I prioritized clarity and maintainability. 
  * Renamed Browser to BrowserSession to prevent namespace collisions with classes in `Basin.Core`.


## v1.1.3

* **[NEW âœ¨]** Added an `ElementTimeout` property to `IBrowserConfig` used in the `Element` class as a default inline timeout.
* **[NEW âœ¨]** Added an `IfTextMatches(string pattern)` method to `Element` class that returns the element if text matches and throws an error if it doesn't.
* **[HOUSEKEEPING ðŸ§¹]** Cleaned up `Element` class by removed unnecessary overload constructors. All element locations are based entirely on ILocatorBuilder.

## v1.1.2

* [FIX] Classes can't be named identically to namespaces. Renamed `Basin()` class to `BasinEnv()` to fix namespace issues, but also to be more indicitive of its purpose.

## v1.1.1

* **[NEW]** Added more html tags.
* **[STRUCTURAL]** Renamed static `Driver` class to `Browser`
* **[STRUCTURAL]** Renamed `BSN` to `Basin`.

## v1.1.0

This is mostly comprised of underlying structural changes and CI/CD updates.

* **[NEW]** Automated nuget publishing and github releases
* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** ~~`BSN.*` is now `Basin.*`~~
* **[BREAKING CHANGE]** `DriverFactory()` renamed to `BrowserFactory()` and updated to use decorators


## v0.0.8 

* **[FIX]** PageCollections would throw a duplicate key error. It just returns if the key already exists.
* **[NEW]** New `Locator()` class that builds an XPath selector for you and returns `By.XPath`. If more advance XPath usage is need, Just use the existing `Locate` methods.
  * Usage: `new Locator("table").WithId("earningsTable").By;`
* **[NEW]** Add semantic locate methods. Its possible that there are some missing elements not very commonly used for browser automation. These initial methods should cover most if not all use cases. The `Element()` class was updated with an overload constructor that uses the new `Locator()` class.
  * Current: `public Element LoginButton => Locate(By.CssSelector(".loginBtn"))`;
  * New: `public Element LoginButton => Button.WithClass("loginBtn");`
